# ServerForBettingApplication
Server application for android programme

This is server for my android application. Task of server is parsing NBA results from the website, put them into database, check how were the users betting matches and sending users info about their progess. Thanks to this project, I learnt how to set up server, how to communicate through sockets, how to interact with database and had to read much more about threads and synchronizing access to shared resources.
